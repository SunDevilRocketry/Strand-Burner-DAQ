# S0001-Strand-Burner-DAQ

<p>Current PCB Revision: 1.0</p>
<p>PCB Part Number: S0001</p>

<p>The Solids Strand Burner Data Acquistion board allows the solids team to easily collect the necessary data for 
solid rocket propellant characterization. The board records the pressure reading of a pressure transducer and times the 
propellant burn using continuity readings. The board also features an embedded SD card data logger, which allows for easy access
to the adquired data in case of telemetry failure. </p>
